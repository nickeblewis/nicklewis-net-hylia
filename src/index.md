2020 was a tough year and like many people I ended up working less hours and had to take a different approach to my business from all of the previous years. It was a daunting time and this year is going to be just as tough but at least we all know where we stand as the year begins. 

I have for a long time worked with a variety of javascript frameworks and I have grown tired of many of them. So I decided to create a new domain (this one) and spin up a site using Hylia, a lightweight [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) pre-configured, so that I could start afresh. Itâ€™s by [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) and [friends](https://github.com/aarongustafson/hylia/graphs/contributors).

I was able to get started quickly by [deploying Hylia to Netlify.](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia&stack=cms) clone locally, make changes, push them up and within moments start writing. I'm excited, let's make 2021 a productive and exciting year.
