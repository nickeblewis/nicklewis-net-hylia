Since we are in near lockdown and I am shielding, I thought it would be a cool idea to dig into my archives both from my iPhone and main camera photos. In other words iCloud and Adobe Cloud!

I took this photo towards the end of 2017 when we took a walk around Frensham Little Pond in Surrey, a location we've not visited that much recently. I am looking forward to going back there when we can, as I love it. One of my favourite places.

The light as autumn heads for winter is an absolute delight. Silhouettes and reflections galore and skeletal trees.
