I like to start something new each year and in this case the domain nicklewis.blog was registered today for the sole purpose of having a place to just write without many constraints being in place. Nice. I like this. I have chosen 11ty for the task because I wanted to move away a little bit from sweating over which framework to use. 2020 exhausted me enough and I just want to explore how 11ty can help provide a nicer development experience.

Casting front-end coding tech to one side for the moment, photography remains a strong passion of mine too. However I am shielding again at the moment as our area of the UK is under Covid Tier 4 restrictions, an evolving situation still. In fact a number of people I know have been effected by it in various ways. So to that extent I am putting more constructive photography on complete hold.

However when getting out for excercise during the day, we are choosing places that are not over populated or busy. I am finding the time to take some photos with my iPhone 11 Pro Max.
