It came as no surprise this evening as Boris Johnson announces another lockdown for England and it looks likely that we shall remain in this state until Mid February. What does this mean for my business? I had already decided to put photography on hold in terms of capturing new images and getting out and about, so not much I can do about that. We do really need to stop the spread of Covid, so we do need to do whatever we can. If we are allowed let's say an hour of outdoor exercise each day, fine, I shall take that, it will have to suffice for now. I will find the quietest local locations I can think of.

Thankfully I have plenty of work lined up on the web development front throughout the new lockdown and am now very much setup to work from home anyway. I do really feel bad for those people who can't work from home. I fear that some businesses we know and love around here may never open again after this. However the importance of surviving and staying healthy has always got to trump everything else.

How can you plan at a time like this? It's hard but I do have a couple of projects to deliver by March for my biggest client of the moment. So this calls upon some key skills of mine including.

- Umbraco v8
- .NET
- SQL
- Training a colleague to train an end-client in Umbraco

Is Umbraco a primary skill of mine? Well not exactly, since it is one of many systems I work with but I do have extensive experience with CMS software as a whole. So a great topic to write about on this blog.

I would count my key skills these days being:

- Javascript (React & Vue)
- Markdown
- .Net
- Data
- Photography
- Various other things lol!!

I find writing about the things you know about, no matter what level of experise you admit to, really helps cement the knowledge that you do have. Wouldn't you agree? So you can expect a lot of that kind of thing on this blog. If you want to ask any questions, please use the contact form and we can discuss. Your suggestions may trigger future blog topics.

So strangely I'm not too upset about there being another lockdown, as I have the comfort of my home office, my wife working downstairs for her company and my stepson likewise. I am not isolated from other people. I just need to knuckle down for a very busy start to the year. Spring and Summer are a bit of an unknown in terms of what projects will be on around that time but I feel confident the work will flow in.

## Mentoring and consulting

Would you be interested in any mentoring or consulting services? I offer such services in order to help individuals and businesses achieve more through technology. My main business site is coming together quite well at the moment for promoting my main services. This site is more of a journal, a place to write, a place to share.

Stay safe my friends wherever you are in the world!
